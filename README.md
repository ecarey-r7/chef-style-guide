# Chef Style Guides
## Prelude
> This repository is a group of style guides I follow when writing Chef components.
> As more people begin to contribute to the Rapid7 Cookbooks GitHub organization: [@rapid7-cookbooks](https://github.com/rapid7-cookbooks)
> I'd love for a consistent style to be used across the repositories/cookbooks released.
