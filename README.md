# Ruby Style Guides
## Prelude
> This repository is a group of Ruby style guides I follow when writing Chef components or Ruby in general.
> As more people begin to contribute to the Rapid7 Cookbooks GitHub organization: @rapid7-cookbooks
> I'd love for a consistent style to be used across the repositories/cookbooks released.
> -- Erran Carey, a.k.a @ipwnstuff/@ecarey-r7
